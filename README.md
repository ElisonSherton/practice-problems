# Practice Problems

This repo hosts all the practise problems that I have solved. I am referring to [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice) for problems and trying to solve stuff regularly to become better at DSA for coding interviews.

This is a good [roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) provided at neetcode which I am following to solve problems step by step.
